# About Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular on your Apple Watch

Your Apple Watch uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate with your paired iPhone.
If you have cellular, your watch can also stay connected through a cellular network.
Your watch switches between these intelligently to choose the most power-efficient connection. Here's how:

- Your Apple Watch uses Bluetooth when your iPhone is near, which conserves power.

- If Bluetooth isn't available, your Apple Watch will try to use Wi-Fi.
For example, if compatible Wi-Fi is available and your iPhone isn't in Bluetooth range, your Apple Watch uses Wi-Fi.

- If Bluetooth and Wi-Fi aren't available, and you set up a cellular plan, cellular models of Apple Watch can connect to cellular networks.
