# Calibrating your Apple Watch for improved accuracy

```{tip}
Your Apple Watch uses your personal information â€” such as your height, weight, gender, and age â€” to calculate how many calories you burn and more.
Calibrate your Apple Watch to improve the accuracy of your distance, pace, and calorie measurements.
```

1. While wearing your Apple Watch, go to a flat, open outdoor area that offers good GPS reception and clear skies

2. Open the Workout app, then tap Outdoor Walk or Outdoor Run

3. Walk or run at your normal pace for about 20 minutes
